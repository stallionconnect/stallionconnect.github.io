Styles live in `assets/css/styles.css`, scripts in `assets/js/main.js` and images in `assets/img/`. There is no build step: edit the files and push.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder:

```bash
python -m http.server 5500
```

then visit http://localhost:5500.

## Before launch

- **Forms** run in demo mode and send nothing. Set `FORM_ENDPOINT` in `assets/js/main.js` (for example a Formspree form URL) to receive enquiries and job applications by email.
- **Placeholders** are marked `TODO` in the HTML: office address, phone number, working hours, social media links, the "24×7" figure, careers perks and job openings.
- **Logo** files in `assets/img/` (header `logo.png`, footer `logo-white.png`, icons and `og-image.jpg`) are made from the client's logo with the punch line. Regenerate them if the logo changes.
